  "readme": "## knox-mpu\n\nA Node.js client designed to make large file uploads to Amazon S3 via the [MultiPartUpload API](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/sdksupportformpu.html) simple and easy. It's built on top of the excellent [Knox](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox) library from the guys over at LearnBoost.\n\n### Features\n\n* Simple and easy to use\n* Pipe either a file, or a stream directly to S3 (No need to know the content length first!)\n* Automatically separates a file/stream into appropriate sized segments for upload\n* Asynchronous uploading of segments\n* Handy events to track your upload progress\n\n_Planned_\n\n* Better error handling (reuploading failed parts, etc)\n\n### Installing\n\nInstallation is done via NPM, by running ```npm install knox-mpu```\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Uploading a stream\n\nTo upload a stream, simply pass the stream when constructing the MultiPartUpload. The upload will then listen to the stream, and create parts from incoming data stream. When a part reaches the minimum part size, it will attempt to upload it to S3.\n\n```javascript\n\n// Create a Knox client first\nvar client = knox.createClient({ ... }),\n    upload = null;\n    \n\nupload = new MultiPartUpload(\n            {\n                client: client,\n                objectName: 'destination.txt', // Amazon S3 object name\n                stream: stream\n            },\n            // Callback handler\n            function(err, res) {\n                // If successful, will return a JSON object containing Location, Bucket, Key and ETag of the object\n            }\n        );\n````\n\n#### Uploading a file\n\nTo upload a file, pass the path to the file in the constructor. Knox-mpu will split the file into parts and upload them.\n\n```javascript\n\n// Create a Knox client first\nvar client = knox.createClient({ ... }),\n    upload = null;\n    \n\nupload = new MultiPartUpload(\n            {\n                client: client,\n                objectName: 'destination.txt', // Amazon S3 object name\n                file: ... // path to the file\n            },\n            // Callback handler\n            function(err, res) {\n                // If successful, will return a JSON object containing Location, Bucket, Key and ETag of the object\n            }\n        );\n````\n### Options\n\nThe following options can be passed to the MultiPartUpload constructor -\n\n* ```client``` _Required_ The knox client to use for this upload request\n* ```objectName``` _Required_ The destination object name/path on S3 for this upload\n* ```stream``` The stream to upload (required if file is not being supplied)\n* ```file``` The path to the file (required if stream is not being supplied)\n* ```headers``` Any additional headers to include on the requests\n* ```partSize``` The minimum size of the parts to upload (default to 5MB).\n\n### Events\n\nThe MultiPartUpload will emit a number of events -\n\n* ```initiated``` Emitted when the multi part upload has been initiated, and received an upload ID. Passes the upload id through as the first argument to the event\n* ```uploading``` Emitted each time a part starts uploading. The part id is passed as the first argument.\n* ```uploaded``` Emitted each time a part finishes uploading. Passes through an object containing the part id and Amazon ETag for the uploaded part. \n* ```error``` Emitted each time a part upload fails. Passes an object containing the part id and error message\n* ```completed``` Emitted when the upload has completed successfully. Contains the object information from Amazon S3 (location, bucket, key and ETag)\n",
